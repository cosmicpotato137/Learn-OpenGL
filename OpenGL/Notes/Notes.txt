Remember: OpenGL is a state machine
A buffer is just allocated memory

fragment shader called many times, vertex shader called a few times

fragment shader: determines color of each pixel
vertex shader: determines position of verticies

vertex array obj contains binding between vertex buffer and vertex layout/spec

size = bytes, count = element count

Pipeline: vertex array -> vertex buffer ->
